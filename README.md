Installation
------------

### Composer

The recommended installation method is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), a dependency manager for PHP. Just add
`jstayton/google-maps-geocoder` to your project's `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "jstayton/google-maps-geocoder": "*"
    }
}
```

[More details](http://packagist.org/packages/jstayton/google-maps-geocoder) can
be found over at [Packagist](http://packagist.org).

### Manually

1.  Copy `src/GoogleMapsGeocoder.php` to your codebase, perhaps to the `vendor`
    directory.
2.  Add the `GoogleMapsGeocoder` class to your autoloader or `require` the file
    directly.

Getting Started
---------------

We'll use the address of [Monk Development](http://monkdev.com) for this
example:

```php
$address = "2707 Congress St., San Diego, CA 92110";
```

There are two ways to set the address of a `GoogleMapsGeocoder` object. Either
the address can be passed to the constructor:

```php
$Geocoder = new GoogleMapsGeocoder($address);
```

Or the address can be set after the object is created:

```php
$Geocoder = new GoogleMapsGeocoder();
$Geocoder->setAddress($address);
```

By default, the `format` is set to `json` and the `sensor` is set to `false`.
These values can be changed either through the constructor or after the object
is created. See the
[documentation](http://jstayton.github.io/GoogleMapsGeocoder/classes/GoogleMapsGeocoder.html)
for the complete list of API parameters that can be changed.

Once all parameters are set, the final step is to send the request to the
Google Maps Geocoding API:

```php
$response = $Geocoder->geocode();
```

The `geocode` method converts the response into a JSON associative array
(default) or `SimpleXMLElement` object depending on the specified `format`. See
the `geocode`
[documentation](http://jstayton.github.io/GoogleMapsGeocoder/classes/GoogleMapsGeocoder.html#method_geocode)
for making the request over HTTPS or preventing conversion (instead returning
the raw plain text response).

Authenticated Call
--------

All Geocoding API applications should use an API key. Including a key in your request:

- Allows you to monitor your application's API usage in the Google Developers Console.
- Enables per-key instead of per-IP-address quota limits.
- Ensures that Google can contact you about your application if necessary.

```php
$Geocoder->setApiKey('xxxxxxxxxxxxx');
```
